## Overview

The "Introduction to Computer Networks" section provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and principles of computer networks. You will learn about the importance of computer networks, their components, and the different types of networks commonly used today.

## Key Concepts

In this section, you will explore the following key concepts:

1. **Definition and significance of computer networks**:

   - A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, routers, and switches) that can communicate and share resources with each other. Computer networks are crucial for facilitating data transfer, enabling collaboration, and accessing shared resources in various settings, including homes, offices, and the internet.

2. **Types of computer networks (LAN, WAN, MAN)**:

   - Computer networks can be classified into different types based on their geographic coverage:
   - Local Area Network (LAN) covers a small area, such as a home, office, or building.
   - Wide Area Network (WAN) spans a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs or sites.
   - Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) covers a city or metropolitan area, providing connectivity between LANs.

3. **Network topologies (bus, star, ring, mesh)**:

   - Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of a network. Common topologies include:
     - Bus: All devices are connected to a single shared communication line.
     - Star: Devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
     - Ring: Devices form a closed loop, with each device connected to two neighboring devices.
     - Mesh: Devices are interconnected with multiple direct links between them.

4. **Network protocols and standards**:

   - Network protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received between devices on a network. Standards, such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), provide a common framework for communication and ensure interoperability between different network devices and systems.

5. **Network devices (routers, switches, modems)**:

   - Network devices play crucial roles in facilitating network connectivity and communication:
     - Routers: Forward data packets between different networks, making decisions based on network addressing and routing protocols.
     - Switches: Connect devices within a network and facilitate communication by directing data packets to their intended destinations.
     - Modems: Convert digital data to analog signals for transmission over telephone lines or cable systems and vice versa.

6. **Network addressing (MAC address, IP address)**:
   - Network addressing is used to identify devices on a network:
     - MAC address (Media Access Control): A unique identifier assigned to the network interface of a device. It operates at the data link layer and is typically assigned by the manufacturer.
     - IP address (Internet Protocol): A numerical address assigned to each device on an IP network. It allows devices to communicate and be located within a network or on the internet.
